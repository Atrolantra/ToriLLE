# ToriLLE
Toribash Learning Environment

## Requirements
* Numpy
* FileLock

## Setup (14.4.2018)
**This will override `data/scripts/startup.lua` file in Toribash.**
1. Copy contents of `toribash` directory into Toribash game folder (`profile.tbs` should be next to `toribash.exe`)
2. Launch the game. It should stay stuck in white screen for a period of time (attempts to connect to controller).
   This will also set up some settings for faster execution.

Minimizing the Toribash game speeds up execution. 

## Notes
- Launching a Toribash instance requires a lock to avoid mixing up connections with controller,
hence booting up multiple Toribashes at same time will take time!

## Todos
### Fixes/Problems/Bugs:

- Toribash instances do not close on Windows when Python script exits. Manually terminate processes.
- Some settings do not seem to be adjustable from commands (e.g. shaders). Provide appropiate config file?
- Make Toribash windows go minimized on launch (increases fps)
- Add possibility to get default options (torille.get_default.settings)
- Add gym-like calls? (make, get action space, etc)
- Consider increasing TIMEOUT time (some agents may take long time to boot)
- Consider using simple filelocking for locking
- Add possibility to change the port and listening address

### Feature/soon-to-be-done TODOs:

- Add state-machine-like checking for better error reporting
- Make gym-env
- Add rotations to the state representation?
- Make changing gamemod possible
- Make Torille pip-installable (maybe even include Toribash binary?)
    - Permission from hampa to share it
    - Contents of following directories can be removed:
        - "custom"
        - "replay"
        - "Extra Content"
        - "data/script/torishop"
        - "data/script/atmo"
        - "data/script/clans"
        - "data/sounds"
    - (500MB -> 40MB)
- Something else seems to be slowing down things too

- Episode restart is rather slow, especially if all instances reboot at once
    - Could this be better if e.g. we move all files to ram?
- A2C does not seem to work, at least in this environment 
- Add possibility to "display window" and run the game at reasonable speed ("render=True")

### Future TODOs:
- Add swords and other items
- Add description of the environment
- Add possibility to use rendered images?

## Running on Linux (tested Ubuntu 16.04)
Windows binaries tested to work on Wine 3.0. **Note that distribution's own version may be outdated!**
Follow installation instrunctions [here](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) to install appropiate version.

### Headless on Linux
Game won't launch without a display (requires OpenGL).
Using Xvfb you can create a virtual display, e.g.

`xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 80x60x24" path_to_toribash_exe`

or by separately running the Xvfb server

```
Xvfb :0 -screen 0 80x60x24 &
DISPLAY=:0 path_to_toribash.exe
```

This will run the game with software OpenGL renderer, reducing the FPS with ~25%.

### Troubleshooting for headless
- Nvidia drivers do not work well with Xvfb. You will likely get some errors about GLX.
    - But fear not, you "only" have to reinstall drivers/CUDA without OpenGL files if you need the drivers:
    - This gist covers the reinstallation: https://gist.github.com/8enmann/931ec2a9dc45fde871d2139a7d1f2d78
        - **However** on Ubuntu 16.04 you may get "pre-install script failed" or "build error" messages:
            - Download other version of drivers than suggested 384.59. For me version 387.34 installed correctly.
            - (Possibly optional) Check if you have `/usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install` file. If it only has `exit 1`, rename/remove this file.
