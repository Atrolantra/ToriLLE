# ToriLLE
Toribash Learning Environment. Extra "L" to make words more memorable for Finns ("Torille" = "To the marketplace").

ToriLLE provides learning/software agents an interface to video-game [Toribash](http://www.toribash.com/), a humanoid fighting game.
Toribash provides environment for MuJoCo-like humanoid control, specifically aimed for competitive nature. This makes
ToriLLE suitable for e.g. self-play experiments. 

ToriLLE comes with a Python interface and pre-made OpenAI Gym environments. Following white-paper includes baseline experiments and benchmarks conducted using ToriLLE: **TBA**

We wouldn't mind a citation if you find ToriLLE useful in your work. It also helps us to see what people have been up to!

  Eprint = {TBA},

```

## Requirements
Tested to work on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04. 

* Numpy (Python)
* FileLock (Python)
* Wine (For Linux. **Requires modern version. Tested on 3.0.x**)

## Quickstart
Following will download ToriLLE with stripped down version of Toribash:
```
pip install torille
```

Random agent:
```python
from torille import ToribashControl, create_random_actions
toribash = ToribashControl()
# Show gameplay
toribash.init(draw_game=True)

# Random agent
while 1:
    state, t = toribash.get_state()
    if t: break
    toribash.make_actions(create_random_actions())
toribash.close()
```

OpenAI Gym environments:
```python
import gym
import torille.envs
env = gym.make("Toribash-DestroyUke-v0")

# Show gameplay
env.set_draw_game(True)

initial_state = env.reset()
t = False
# Random agent
while not t:
    s, r, t, _ = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
env.close()
```

## Manual installation 

You can install ToriLLE without PyPi/pip with the following:

* Install [Toribash](www.toribash.com/)
* Copy contents of `toribash-codes` to Toribash installation directory. Overwrite files
  * **Note: ** This will prevent using that specific installation as a regular game. Remove/rename `profile.tbs` file 
               to revert most of the changes and use game normally again.
* Provide path the installed `toribash.exe` when creating `ToribashControl` objects (if you use provided Python library)

## Repository structure
- `./torille/`: Python codes for the learning environment (inc. Gym environment)
  - `./torille/toribash`: This will include stripped version of the Toribash game when installed from PyPi
- `./toribash-codes/`: Files required for Toribash to make this learning environment work 
- `./examples/`: Python examples on how to use this library
- `./docs/`: Detailed documentation of the inner workings
- `./experiments/`: Codes used to run experiments in the white paper
- `./images/`: Contains GIFs used here
